## Background 
This is a simple classification project detecting happy and unhappy customers from a mock dataset. 

Data Description:

Y = target attribute (Y) with values indicating 0 (unhappy) and 1 (happy) customers
X1 = my order was delivered on time
X2 = contents of my order was as I expected
X3 = I ordered everything I wanted to order
X4 = I paid a good price for my order
X5 = I am satisfied with my courier
X6 = the app makes ordering easy for me

Using the the dataset provided by Apziva, and the key above, the goal is to reach at least 73% model accuracy, or convince the audicence why my solution is superior.
